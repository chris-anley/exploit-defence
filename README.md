# Exploit Defence Notes

These notes are a random collection of links, talking points, simple explanations and interesting posts relating to Exploit Defence, i.e. mitigations and bypasses relating to arbitrary-code execution vulnerabilities.

This is not a tutorial, nor a review of any particular product or a critique of any specific technique, it's just a collection of interesting things related to the general field of exploit defence.

# Some Categories of Vuln

...with occasional CWE references (the CWE taxonomy is debatable but generally great)

- Buffer Overflow - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html
  - Stack Overflow
  - Heap Overflow
- Buffer Underflow - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/786.html
- Out of Bounds Read / Write (single element)
  - Off by One
    - Null byte append
  - Signedness index
  - Wraparound index
  - User-specified size/count
- Format String (yes, still)
- Use After Free (Expired Pointer Reference)  
  - Double Free
- Type Confusion - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html
- Uninitialised pointer reference - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/824.html
- Information Leak
  - Unclean buffer / reuse of previous allocation
  - Buffer over-read - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/126.html

# Use After Free

Example: WidgetAPI; allocWidget(), freeWidget(), getWidgetID(), setWidgetID().
Calling alloc, free, then get() returns whatever is in the location. 

# Type Confusion

Example: API for type A and B. We pass a handle to B to a call to an A method. Can be read, write primitive, or even call/jmp.
