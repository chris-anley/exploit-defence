# Exploit Defence Notes

These notes are a random collection of links, talking points, simple explanations and interesting posts relating to Exploit Defence, i.e. mitigations and bypasses relating to arbitrary-code execution vulnerabilities.

This is not a tutorial, nor a review of any particular product or a critique of any specific technique, it's just a collection of interesting things related to the general field of exploit defence.

# Use After Free

Example: WidgetAPI; allocWidget(), freeWidget(), getWidgetID(), setWidgetID().
Calling alloc, free, then get() returns whatever is in the location. 

# Type Confusion

Example: API for type A and B. We pass a handle to B to a call to an A method. Can be read, write primitive, or even call/jmp.
